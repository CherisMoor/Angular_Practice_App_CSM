#### ANGULAR DAY 1

**_Angular 1 - JAVASCRIPT_**
**_ANGULAR 2+ - TYPESCRIPT_**

! You can use typescript with React JS !

-"Typescript" is a superset of javascript

### Creators:

- Google is force behind Angular
- Facebook is force behind ReactJS
- Twitter is force behind BootStrap
- jQuery

### Languages

- JavaScript
- Typescript

### Framework

- Angular (More behind the scenes)
- jQuery
- ReactJS (considered a FrontEnd framework)

### 3 Things our Browser will understand

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
  -(Broken down into bytecode so the Browser can read it)
  - Backend (Node, SpringBoot, Express)
  - Frontend ()

### ANGULAR

- An open source (accessible to everyone) web framework developed and maintained by Google
- Version control: saving versions of your code(Ex: GitHub owned by Microsoft)
- Angular uses TypeScript for its implementation.
- Strict superset of JavaScript.
- Must be compiled (transpiled) before deployment.
- How to install?

  > npm install -g typescript
  > tsc -v

- Since TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, all JavaScript code is also TypeScript code.
- If JavaScript code is run through the tsc compiler it comes out unchanged.

### TypeScript supports the same basic types as JavaScript:

- boolean
- string
- number
  **_ Specified after the variable name with a colon. _**

### There are more types:

- enum - a named set of contants
  - Size = {Small, Medium, Large}
- any - dynamic type
  - a signal for the compile to not check this variable.
- void - no value
  - mainly used on functions of no return.

### Interfaces

- Enforce the "shape" of data.
- Can include optional and readonly properties

### Classes

- Define shape and functionality.
- Properties, methods, and constructor.
- Inheritance is supported.
- Declared with the new() statement.

### Functions

- Functions are a fundamental type in JavaScript - but behave a little differently in TypeScript.
- By default, all parameters are required.

- Optional parameters are included one of two ways:
  - using ? syntax
  - specifying a default
